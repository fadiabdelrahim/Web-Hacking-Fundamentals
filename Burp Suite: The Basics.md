<h1>Burp Suite: The Basics Walkthrough</h1>

<h2>Task 1: Introduction</h2>

Welcome to Burp Suite Basics!

This room will cover the foundations of using the Burp Suite web application framework.
Specifically, we will be looking at:

- What Burp Suite is
- An overview of the available tools in the framework
- Installing Burp Suite for yourself
- Navigating and configuring Burp Suite.

We will also be introducing the core of the Burp Suite framework: the Burp Proxy. This room is primarily designed to provide a foundational knowledge of Burp Suite which can then be built upon further in the other rooms of the Burp module; as such, it will be a lot heavier in theory than subsequent rooms, which take more of a practical approach. You are advised to read the information here and follow along yourself with a copy of the tool if you haven't used Burp Suite before. Experimentation is key: use this information in tandem with playing around with the app for yourself to build a foundation for using the framework, which can then be built upon in later rooms.

Let's begin!

<h2>Task 2: The OSI Model - An Overview</h2>

</p>

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standardised model which we use to demonstrate the theory behind computer networking. In practice, it's actually the more compact TCP/IP model that real-world networking is based off; however the OSI model, in many ways, is easier to get an initial understanding from.

<b>The OSI model consists of seven layers:</b>
